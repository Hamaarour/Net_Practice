You will have to configure small-scale networks. To do so, it will be necessary to understand how TCP/IP addressing works.

## What is a network switch?

A network switch connects devices within a network (often a local area network, or LAN*) and forwards data packets to and from those devices. Unlike a router, a switch only sends data to the single device it is intended for (which may be another switch, a router, or a user's computer), not to networks of multiple devices.

*(A local area network (LAN) is a group of connected devices within close physical proximity. Home WiFi networks are one common example of a LAN.)

## What is the purpose of a Hub
the porpose is to connect all of your network devices toghether on an internal network, it's devices that has a multiple ports that accepts Ethernet connections from network devices
the only thing a hub knows is when a device is connected to one of its ports.

## What is a Switch
Also a device with multiple ports that accepts Ethernet connections from network devices but Unlike a hub a switch is intelligent . a switch can actually learn the physical adresses of the devices that are connected to it and it stores these physical adresses called Mac adresses in its table
