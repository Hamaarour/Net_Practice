You will have to configure small-scale networks. To do so, it will be necessary to understand how TCP/IP addressing works.

## What is a network switch?

A network switch connects devices within a network (often a local area network, or LAN*) and forwards data packets to and from those devices. Unlike a router, a switch only sends data to the single device it is intended for (which may be another switch, a router, or a user's computer), not to networks of multiple devices.
